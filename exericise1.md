Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) refer to the software development methodology, in which developers’ code changes are merged frequently to a deployable source code branch. This branch in CD practice is kept deployable via certain automated checking phases such as code checking via linting and testing. The automated pipeline can run from these checking phases via code building and packaging up till deployment to production.

In this essay we discuss some of the alternatives for the tools for a CI/CD pipeline for python language. Python has numerous alternatives for such tools. In the early phases of the pipeline a code checker such as pylint, mypy or flake8 can be used. A unit test tool called PyUnit is inbuilt to python and the tests can be run in a straight forward fashion from the command line or as part of scripts or configuration files describing a CI/CD pipeline. 

For integration testing one option is Selenium, which can be used to automate web browser interaction and thus to write tests for an application with a web front end. For Selenium to work, one needs a browser instance, as it does not render the pages itself. Services offering CI/CD pipeline platforms, such as Bitbucket, GitHub and GitLab use docker images as building blocks of the pipelines to be run in virtual machines in the cloud. The content of these images can be specified via docker/docker compose files or via yaml configuration files. Browser images are readily available to work in conjunction with Selenium images. One can specify what to include in the builds by configuring the appropirate containers accordingly.

In the course we are using GitHub actions to construct CI/CD workflows in GitHub. One alternative to GitHub actions and workflows is the already mentioned Bitbucket pipes. Bitbucket offers similar Git based source code repository to GitHub and it offers integrations similarly to GitHub with services such as Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure for deployment. Bitbucket offers both cloud and self-managed options called Cloud and Data Center respectively. The Data Center offering naturally requires much more maintenance effort. On the other hand data storage can be scaled by one’s needs more granularly. For small scale projects the Cloud -option is the way to go as it has a free tier.
